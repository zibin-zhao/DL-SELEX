# Supplementary code for "Accelerating Small-Molecule Aptamer Selection with Structural-Focused DL-SELEX, Starting with Steroid"

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/898798378.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14281817)

## Tested environment

* Ubuntu == 20.04
* python == 3.9
* pytorch == 1.5.0
* cuda == 12.1

## AptaVAE

The AptaVAE is designed as the first part of the DL-SELEX approach, which generates the pre-defined guided initial library of the collected steroids. The detailed workflow of how the code works can be found inside the AptaVAE folder with the README file. 

## AptaClux

The AptaClux can be accessed via the online server in http://hsingapp.ust.hk or downloaded via the source code in the AptaClux folder. To deploy the model locally for their own used, detailed procedure can be found in the README file under the AptaClux directory.

## Figures

The folder Figures contains the Python scripts for data visualization in this manuscript.
